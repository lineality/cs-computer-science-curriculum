# Approaches To Designing a "CS" Curriculum
10
1. Follow curricula posted by established institutions:
11
http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/ You could source a topic/skill list from this as a content map, and then source further instruction from online. 
12
Note: This will likely be shifted towards abstract principles (and away from practical implementation)
13
https://www.khanacademy.org/  tends to be very reliable.

2. Use "the standard technical interview" or "coding interview" as your guide to compiling a primary skill/ability list:
16
Note: This will likely be shifted towards practical programming (and way from abstract principle discussion). https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850

3. Another approach is extensive use of free code challenge and exam sites:
19
(The idea being that in the course of doing so you will discover a cross section of practical and theoretical topics.)

In this guide we will sample from all of the above approaches.

# Curriculum Standards:
35
Regardless of the subject area of the course of study, there are best practice standards for what should be included in an effective curriculum.
36
1. A clear and comprehensive content-curriculum
37
2. Teaching method standards (see ISEP areas / SNES)
38
3. Content Maps per lesson/sub-unit
39
4. Team project modes
40
5. Story/Narrative based
41
6. Cumulative-Review
42
7. Student Progression Feedback Based
43
8. Pre, Post, Formative, Summative, Testing and separated instruction and certification
