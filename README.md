This guide will walk through the process of designing a Computer Science study curriculum. 

# Approaches To Designing a "CS" Curriculum
1. Follow curricula posted by established institutions:
http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/ You could source a topic/skill list from this as a content map, and then source further instruction from online. 
Note: This will likely be shifted towards abstract principles (and away from practical implementation)
https://www.khanacademy.org/  tends to be very reliable.

2. Use "the standard technical interview" or "coding interview" as your guide to compiling a primary skill/ability list:
Note: This will likely be shifted towards practical programming (and way from abstract principle discussion). https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850

3. Another approach is extensive use of free code challenge and exam sites:
(The idea being that in the course of doing so you will discover a cross section of practical and theoretical topics.)
- Leetcode https://leetcode.com/ 
- Edabyte https://edabit.com/
- Code Signal  https://app.codesignal.com/ 
- JetBrains https://hyperskill.org/curriculum
- Hackerrank https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ 
- Triplebyte https://triplebyte.com/

Mobile:
- Sololearn https://www.sololearn.com/
- m1m0 https://getmimo.com/ 
- Grasshopper (Google) https://grasshopper.app/ 

In this guide we will sample from all of the above approaches.

# Curriculum Standards:
Regardless of the subject area of the course of study, there are best practice standards for what should be included in an effective curriculum.
1. A clear and comprehensive content-curriculum
2. Teaching method standards (see ISEP areas / SNES)
3. Content Maps per lesson/sub-unit
4. Team project modes
5. Story/Narrative based
6. Cumulative-Review
7. Student Progression Feedback Based
8. Pre, Post, Formative, Summative, Testing and separated instruction and certification
9. Privacy Conscious

# CS curricula commonly include these general areas: 
- Languages (Languages programming & scripting Languages): types, features, uses
- Programming: problem solving strategies, debugging, testing, functions, OOP vs Functional, etc.
- Data Structures
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithms & Time/Memory Complexity
- SCRUM software team project organization
- History of Computer Development


# History:
Two good accessible (for any reader) history of computers books are:
- https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703
- https://www.amazon.com/Information-History-Theory-Flood-ebook/dp/B004DEPHUC

# Curriculum Standards: An effective curriculum should be...
- Project Based (learn by doing, fail early and often)
- Narrative or Story Based
- Cumulative-Review Based
- Modular-Recombination Based
- Team-Work Based


# Elements of Programming:

## Files:
- print
- open
- change
- save

## Operations: Types of Operations & Specific Operations
- Logical operators: not,  and, or, nor, nand
- Math Operations: * ** / // % + - 
- Directory Operations: move
- File Operations: open close 
- String Operations: print, slice, 
- Data Structure Operations: slice, append, remove, add, pop, push, 
- Boolean Operations: True False: && | == is and not 
- Bitwise Operations: ^ & or
- Unpacking (as in Tuple Unpacking)
- Mutability: ability or inability to be changed
- List Comprehensions

## Data Types:
- Examples of Types: int long short float char boolean 
- Automatic Type Detection:
- Strict or not-strict Typing:

## Data Structures
- Lists/Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Linked-lists
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Trees
- Sets
- Tuples
- Streams
- Queues
- Strings
- Stacks
- Blobs
- Flat "Serialized" Structures
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Sets 
- Maps (HashMaps, SortedMaps, TreeMaps, ListMaps)
- Sequences(Seq)

## Bug Prevention & Best Practice
- preventative methods
- standards and policies (e.g. PEP8)
- linters
- formaters

## Debugging Etc.

Debugging as "walk through the code step by step."

Content Map Skills for Debugging:
- breakpoints
- traversing
- "current scope"
- step into vs. step out
- call stack
- variables: local vs. global
- the debugger-console
- inspecting 'state'



## Other Elements of Coding & Programing
- Time Complexity, Space Complexity, & 'Big O' Notation
- Recursion & Base Cases
- Objects
- Functions
- Lambda Functions
- Methods
- Vectors
- Tensors
- Matrices

## Algorithms
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/syllabus/
- Sorting
- Runtime
- Memory Costs

### On "Programing"
- "Programming" vs. "Computer Science": Depending on the course, Programing and  Computer-Science may be lumped together or taught separately or only one may be touched on. The distinction (if one is made) is often similar to the 'pure vs. applied' divide common throughout science and engineering, etc. 'Computer Science' is often pure ideas and ideals, concepts and principles. 'Programing' is often full of specific hardware-and-software skills and various practical considerations in doing projects in the real world.  
- Style:  The primary question and criteria for anything added to or done to a set of code is: How does this make the code easier to read, understand, and build on? If the addition or change does not help in any of those contexts, that is a red flag. There are people who aggressively attack readability, which is also a red flag. 
- Terminal & Bash
- Deployment (making products available to users)
- Tools (Text Editor, vs Word Processor; IDE; Notebooks) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZJI20D7uIknT1pdlTSmlHH1WPYdVhs2PSUyH1qdnUo/ 
- Interpreters, Compilers
- Managing 'Environments' (Docker, Pip)
- Workflow (Data Science workflow vs. WebDev workflow)
- Best Practice
- Practical Skills
- Managing Environments and Tools
- Policy and Goals:
- Schedules and "Iterative" feature deployment:  Agile, Scrum
- Working On A Team: Agile, Scrum
- Networks (setting up HTTPS, remote SSH)
- Security (passwords, encryption, social engineering, etc.)

### S.U.P.E.R. Problem Solving Framework
For solving problems that either at first seem too difficult to solve or problems that seemed easy at first but became difficult and confusing (for example, due to incomplete or incorrect instructions, as often happens on 'code challenge' websites), S.U.P.E.R. is one among many synonymous acronym frameworks for using best practice to systematically break down and solve a problem, cutting through other confusions, distractions, etc. 

```
S.U.P.E.R.
S -> Stop, Focus, Take a deep breath
U -> Understand the problem, read all the documentation, look at example inputs and outputs, examine code tests, look at edge case policies, etc. Know exactly what is needed.
P -> Plan (pseudocode) Before starting to write your actual code, make a flow-chart and or pseudo-code outline, often running through a few examples to trace through how the process works
E -> Execute, MVP; Start with a minimal working version/vision, test constantly as you work through each part, 
R -> Reflect / Revise / Reiterate / Recurse / Review / Compare; talk to other people, get feedback on alternative solutions, figure out what could be done better; identify tradeoffs and debates, though you may be correct in your case. 
```
