# Approaches
1. One method is to follow the curricula posted by established institutions:
http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/
You could source a topic/skill list from this as a content map, and then source further instruction from online. https://www.khanacademy.org/  tends to be very reliable.

2. Another approach is to use the "standard technical interview" as your guide to compiling a primary skill/ability list: https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850

3. Another approach is extensive use of free code challenge and exam sites:
- leetcode https://leetcode.com/ 
- edabyte https://edabit.com/
- code signal  https://app.codesignal.com/ 
- JetBrains https://hyperskill.org/curriculum
- hackerrank https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/
- sololearn https://www.sololearn.com/ (great on mobile)
- tribyte https://triplebyte.com/


# CS curricula commonly include: 
- Languages (Languages programming & scripting Languages): types, features, uses
- Programming: problem solving strategies, debugging, testing, functions, OOP vs Functional
- Data Structures
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithms & Time/Memory Complexity
- SCRUM software team project organization
- History of Computer Development


# History:
Two good accessible (for any reader) history of computers books are:
- https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703
- https://www.amazon.com/Information-History-Theory-Flood-ebook/dp/B004DEPHUC

# Curriculum Standards: An effective curriculum should be...
- Project Based (learn by doing, fail early and often)
- Narrative or Story Based
- Cumulative-Review Based
- Modular-Recombination Based
- Team-Work Based

......

# Elements of Programming:

## Files:
	- print
	- open
	- change
	- save

## Types of Operations & Specific Operations
- Math Operations: * ** / // % + - 
- directory: move
- file: open close 
- string: print, slice, 
- data structure: slice, append, remove, add, pop, push, 
- boolean: True False && | == is and not 
- bitwize: ^ & or
(mutability) 

## Data Structures
	- Lists/Arrays
	- Dictionaries
	- Linked-lists
	- Heaps
	- Graphs
	- Trees
	- Sets
	- Tuples
	- 

### On Programing 
### Intro: programming vs. "Computer Science"
- style
-- The primary question and criteria for anything added or done to a set of code is: How does this make the code easier to read, understand, and build on? If the addition or change does not help those, that is a red flag.
- workflow
- best practice
- practical skills
- managing environments and tools 

# Sample Starting Point / Starting Lesson
## Recommended First Language: Python

## Main Tools:
- Editor (Text editor, ~ IDE, like Word Processor)
- Terminal (Command Prompt, Shell, ~Bash)
- Notebook (Jyputer, Colab)

## Environment:
	- local or online
	- linter, formater
	- virtual/container

~ U.P.E.R.
U -> Understand
P -> Plan (pseudocode)
E -> Execute 
R -> Reflect / Revise / Reiterate / Recurse / Review / Compare
