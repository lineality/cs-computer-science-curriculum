1. What are "types"? Why do we use "types?"
Here are some examples to show how you already use 'types' in daily life, perhaps without thinking much about it. 

If someone gave you the following instructions you would understand how to deal with the underlined parts of the following sentences, because you would have understood the "types" involved:


Examples:

1. Give file-X to Ms. Grace Hopper. (string: text)
You know "Grace Hopper" is a "string" of letters, a person's name, not a number. 
(a string)

2. Please dial area code 1-202-505-6234 (not a decimal or equation)
You know this is a phone number, not a math equation, not a decimal number, or a positive or negative number. (a literal)

(big or small numbers)
3. How old is she?
This is a number, but how big a number?
You know people live less than 256 years (2^8=256), so 8 bits is fine. It's a "short" number.

4. What amount is the US national debt? 
This is a number, but how big a number?
You know the debt is more than $4,300,000,000 (4.3 billion) US Dollars, and 2^32=4.3 billion so you need a 64 bit number. 
(it would be a "long" or a "double")

5. Give her half of that apple. (float: decimals)
You know you need decimals, (half = 0.5 apples) not just whole number integers.

6. Is the light on in the kitchen? (boolean)
You know this is an on-off, True-False, binary question. 

7. After buying an expensive dinner, Pam's bank account contained negative ten Euros. 
You know this is a negative number (a signed number, as in 'negative sign'). 


1. The question of why we need types (or how we use them), in one or another form, is both interesting to think about and also a practical part of the evolution of Science-Technology-Math-&-Engineering(etc.) on an ongoing basis: types are not now as they once were, nor will they be as they are 'now.' 
In "old" programming languages, there was no ability for the language to recognize types on its own, or to choose what type was best to use. But languages including Kotlin can "infer" or "deduce" the type of a variable or constant value that you create. This also raises many questions: e.g. Who should decide the type, the computer, or the programmer? What tasks (such as type, or memory-management) should be done manually by a person? 

Types are important for efficient use of memory, for privacy and security (all issues that mostly likely people will still be talking about far into the future), part of which is...  

2. A natural grammar of types?
One ongoing puzzle is, despite the multiple millenia head start that research and refinement of mathematics had over computer science, in various ways the often entirely practical ways that computer uses numbers are not identical to the vocabulary for describing numbers that we have inherited from Mathematics. 

When you start programming you may not think that types, or optimization, or synchronization, or centralization, are or should be parts of writing your program. But the landscape of how information works has often demonstrated itself not to be what people had first assumed, or even what we can easily assume. Rather than being obstacles, these are rich parts of a strange world of information that has continually surpassed and contradicted what people "knew" to be real and possible. 

Types may be, or seem to be a small pieces of a big puzzle. But the tips of surprising buried treasure often appear small, ordinary, and unimportant.
